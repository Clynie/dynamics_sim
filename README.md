# dynamics_sim
A generic evolutionary game theory simulation library.

This is based off of Eric Lubins wonderful DyPy library. Andrew Ferdowsian updated it to Python 3.0 with additional functionality. It is now extended to include frequency biased imitation and group selection.

For instructions on usage please see the Wiki.

## Requirements

DyPy depends upon matplotlib for graphing, numpy and joblib. To install these dependencies, make sure you are in the root directory of the repository and run the following command,

``` Code
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
