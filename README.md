# dynamics_sim
A generic evolutionary game theory simulation library.

This is based off of Eric Lubins wonderful DyPy library. Andrew Ferdowsian updated it to Python 3.0 with additional functionality. It is now extended to include frequency biased imitation and group selection.

For instructions on usage please see the Wiki.
